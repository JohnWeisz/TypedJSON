TypedJSON v0.2.0 - https://github.com/JohnWhiteTB/TypedJSON

Typed JSON parsing and serializing that preserves type information. Parse JSON into actual class instances. Recommended (but not required)
to be used with reflect-metadata (global installation): https://github.com/rbuckton/ReflectDecorators.
